# Doki Doki Princess Investigator
<p>Doki Doki Princess Investigator is a game jam experiment from May 2014, featuring art by Lindsay Ishihiro and music by Mike Levens. The game itself is made in the Ren'py Visual Novel Engine, which means I spent most of the weekend struggling to learn Python.</p>
<p>I was intrigued by a prompt from the Orteil insanity game generator: "An FPS in which you investigate princesses in a fantasy world." I was not about to attempt an FPS in a three-day game jam, but the concept of investigating princesses stuck around. The result has elements of both <em>Papers, Please</em> and <em>Princess Maker</em>.</p>
<p>In keeping with my prior game jam attempt, the gameplay is questionable but the art is amazing! I highly recommend enlisting talented artists to distract from your own flaws.</p>
<p>The game (such as it is) runs on Windows, Mac and Linux using the Ren'py engine</p>
